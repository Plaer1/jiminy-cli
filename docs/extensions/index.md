# Jiminy CLI extensions

Jiminy CLI extensions package prompts, MCP servers, custom commands, themes,
hooks, sub-agents, and agent skills into a familiar and user-friendly format.
With extensions, you can expand the capabilities of Jiminy CLI and share those
capabilities with others. They are designed to be easily installable and
shareable.

To see what's possible, browse the
[Jiminy CLI extension gallery](https://jiminycli.com/extensions/browse/).
